## Decision 003: Start with Web, Not WhatsApp

**Date:** February 13, 2026  
**Decision:** Build web MVP first, add messaging (Telegram/WhatsApp) later

**Context:** WhatsApp integration is complex (API approval, costs, legal). Need to validate core product first.

**Options Considered:**
1. Build WhatsApp first (the "ideal" experience)
2. Build web first, add WhatsApp later
3. Build both in parallel

**Rationale:**
- Web is fastest to build and iterate
- No external dependencies (Meta approval)
- Can validate AI quality before scaling
- Lower technical risk
- Telegram can be added in ~1 month when ready

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Faster time to market
- ✅ Easier iteration
- ✅ Lower risk
- ❌ Less "viral" initially
- ❌ Not meeting coaches where they are (yet)

**Consequences:**
- Phase 1 = web only
- Phase 2 = add Telegram
- Phase 3 = apply for WhatsApp API

**Reversible?** ⚠️ Partially. Web will always be needed, but delaying WhatsApp may slow adoption.

## Decision 004: BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) Model

**Date:** February 13, 2026  
**Decision:** Coaches bring their own AI API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

**Context:** Need to decide who pays for AI compute - us or the coaches.

**Options Considered:**
1. **We provide AI** (traditional SaaS)
   - We pay OpenAI, charge coaches markup
   - Simple pricing for coaches
   - High costs for us, margin pressure

2. **BYOK** (Bring Your Own Key)
   - Coaches pay OpenAI directly
   - We charge only for platform
   - Zero AI costs for us

**Rationale:**
- BYOK aligns incentives (coaches control quality/cost)
- Transparent pricing (no hidden AI costs)
- Sustainable unit economics
- Differentiator from competitors
- Future-proof as AI costs drop

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Zero AI infrastructure costs
- ✅ Transparent to coaches
- ✅ Sustainable margins
- ❌ More complex setup for coaches
- ❌ Can't guarantee AI quality (they choose model)

**Mitigation for complexity:**
- Clear setup guides
- Recommended models
- Default to GPT-4 (most coaches will use this)

**Consequences:**
- Pricing is pure SaaS (no usage variables)
- Coaches need OpenAI account
- We focus on platform value

**Reversible?** ⚠️ Hard to reverse. If we switch to "we provide AI" later, we'd need to renegotiate with all customers.

## Decision 005: Target Individual Coaches First, Not Enterprise

**Date:** February 13, 2026  
**Decision:** Start with individual coaches/small practices, expand to enterprise later

**Context:** Need to choose initial target market.

**Options Considered:**
1. **Individual coaches** (B2C/SMB)
   - Large market (100K+ coaches)
   - Faster sales cycle
   - Lower ACV, higher volume
   - Easier to reach

2. **Enterprise** (B2B)
   - Smaller market
   - Longer sales cycle
   - Higher ACV, lower volume
   - Harder to reach

**Rationale:**
- Individual coaches are underserved (BetterUp/CoachHub focus on enterprise)
- Faster feedback loop
- Can build product with real users
- OKR Institute network provides initial access
- Enterprise features can be added later

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Faster to first revenue

## Decision 007: Hybrid AI + Human Model

**Date:** February 13, 2026  
**Decision:** Build a hybrid system where AI handles routine coaching and humans can take over

**Context:** Core product decision - how much AI vs human?

**Options Considered:**
1. **AI-only** (like Noom)
   - Fully automated
   - Scales infinitely
   - Lower perceived value
   - Can't handle complex situations

2. **Human-only** (traditional)
   - No AI value
   - Doesn't scale
   - Not what we're building

3. **Hybrid** (AI default, human handoff)
   - AI handles 80% of conversations
   - Human steps in for complex moments
   - Best of both worlds

**Rationale:**
- Pure AI can't handle nuanced coaching
- Pure human doesn't scale
- Hybrid gives availability + judgment
- Differentiator from Coachvox (AI-only)
- Coaches feel in control

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Scalable (AI handles most)
- ✅ High quality (human backup)
- ✅ Coach control
- ❌ Complex to build (handoff logic)
- ❌ Requires both AI and UX excellence

**Consequences:**
- Need handoff detection system
- Need smooth UX for handoff
- Need context passing (AI summary for human)
- This is a core differentiator

**Reversible?** ⚠️ Hard. This is core to the product identity.

## Decision 008: Open Source vs Closed Source (Undecided)

**Date:** February 13, 2026  
**Status:** DECISION PENDING

**Context:** Should we open source the platform or keep it proprietary?

**Options to Evaluate:**
1. **Fully open source**
   - GitHub public repo
   - Community contributions
   - Harder to monetize
   - Builds trust/audience

2. **Open core**
   - Core platform open
   - Premium features closed
   - Best of both worlds

3. **Closed source**
   - Private repo
   - Full control
   - Standard SaaS model

**Considerations:**
- Open source = marketing/SEO benefits
- Open source = community contributions
- Closed source = easier to build business
- Can always open source later

**Decision Needed By:** Before public launch (Week 15)

## Decision 009: Use RAG (Not Simple File Reading)

**Date:** February 16, 2026  
**Decision:** Implement full RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for coach knowledge bases

**Context:** Coaches will upload 100-1000+ documents (PDFs, videos, notes). Need to decide how to make this content available to AI.

**Options Considered:**
1. **Simple file reading** — Read documents into prompt
   - Simple to implement
   - ❌ Context window limits (can't read 100MB)
   - ❌ Expensive (millions of tokens)
   - ❌ No semantic search

2. **RAG with vector search** — Embeddings + similarity search
   - Scales to unlimited documents
   - Semantic matching ("fraud" → "imposter syndrome")
   - Cost-effective
   - More complex to build

**Rationale:**
- Coaches will have 10-100MB of content (impossible to read all)
- Need semantic search (client doesn't use exact keywords from docs)
- RAG is standard for document Q&A systems
- Supabase pgvector makes it accessible

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Scales infinitely
- ✅ Semantic understanding
- ✅ Cost-effective at scale
- ❌ More complex (embeddings, chunking, vector DB)
- ❌ Added latency (~100-500ms)

**Implementation:**
- Supabase pgvector for vector storage
- OpenAI text-embedding-3-small for embeddings
- Chunk documents into ~500 token pieces
- Cosine similarity search

**Consequences:**
- More complex architecture
- Need document processing pipeline
- Higher initial dev effort
- Future-proof for scale

**Reversible?** ⚠️ Hard. Core architecture decision.

## Decision 010: 4-Layer Memory System

**Date:** February 16, 2026  
**Decision:** Implement 4-layer persistent memory for coach-client relationships

**Context:** Coaching is relational — context from 6 months ago matters. Need more than simple chat history.

**Options Considered:**
1. **Simple chat history** — Store all messages, retrieve recent
   - Easy to implement
   - ❌ Doesn't capture insights
   - ❌ Expensive to include all history
   - ❌ No structured understanding

2. **4-layer memory** — Short-term + Summaries + Insights + Relationship
   - Captures different time horizons
   - Structured + unstructured
   - Efficient (compact representations)
   - More complex

**Layers Chosen:**
1. **Short-term** — Last 10 messages (immediate context)
2. **Session summaries** — AI-generated session overviews
3. **Key insights** — Structured facts (goals, blockers, breakthroughs)
4. **Relationship context** — Meta-information about coaching dynamic

**Rationale:**
- Different information has different shelf life
- Short-term: conversation flow
- Summaries: reference past sessions
- Insights: persistent facts about client
- Relationship: coaching style/preferences

**Consequences:**
- More database tables
- Complex context building logic
- Extraction/analysis prompts needed
- Richer, more personalized coaching

**Reversible?** ⚠️ Moderate. Core feature, but could simplify later.

## Decision 011: Learning System (3 Levels)

**Date:** February 16, 2026  
**Decision:** Build learning system where AI improves from every human intervention

**Context:** AI should get better over time by learning from human coach's style and effective techniques.

**Options Considered:**
1. **Static AI** — AI doesn't learn, always same behavior
   - Simple
   - ❌ Doesn't improve
   - ❌ Not personalized

2. **Learning system** — Analyze human interventions, adapt AI
   - AI improves continuously
   - Personalized to coach style
   - Client-specific adaptations
   - Complex to build

**Levels Chosen:**
1. **Client-specific** — "What works for THIS client"
2. **Coach-specific** — "THIS coach's unique style"
3. **Universal** — "What works across all coaches"

**Rationale:**
- Every human intervention is a learning opportunity
- Creates flywheel: better AI → less human intervention needed → scale
- Differentiator from generic AI tools
- Authentic coach voice preserved

**Mechanism:**
- Analyze human interventions (style, technique, phrases)
- Update client profile (effective approaches)
- Update coach style profile (signature style)
- Contribute to universal patterns (cross-coach learning)

**Consequences:**
- Complex analysis engine needed
- Database tables for learning data
- Dashboard for coaches to see AI learning
- Continuous improvement over time

**Reversible?** ⚠️ Hard. Core to product value proposition.

## Decision 012: Message Attribution System

**Date:** February 16, 2026  
**Decision:** Tag every message with sender type (client/AI/human_coach) and handoff metadata

**Context:** Need to track when human takes over from AI for learning system.

**Options Considered:**
1. **Simple sender field** — Just "client" or "coach"
   - Easy
   - ❌ Can't distinguish AI vs human coach
   - ❌ No handoff tracking

2. **Rich attribution** — sender_type + metadata
   - Tracks AI vs human
   - Records handoff reasons
   - Enables learning analysis

**Metadata Captured:**
- `sender_type`: 'client' | 'ai' | 'human_coach'
- `is_handoff`: Did human take over from AI?
- `handoff_reason`: Why? ('crisis', 'low_confidence', etc.)
- `ai_confidence_before`: AI confidence before handoff

**Rationale:**
- Learning system needs to know which responses were human
- Handoff detection enables intervention analysis
- Understanding why human took over improves AI

**Consequences:**
- More complex message table
- Handoff detection logic needed
- UI for handoff/handback

**Reversible?** ✅ Yes, but would lose learning data.
