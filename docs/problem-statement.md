# 🎯 Problem Statement

## The Coaching Industry is Broken

### 1. Coaches Can't Scale

**The Problem:**
- A coach has ~11.6 billable hours per week (industry average)
- At $234/hour (North America avg), that's ~$2,714/week = $141K/year
- To earn more, they must: raise prices (market resistance) or work more (burnout)
- **There's a hard ceiling on income**

**The Impact:**
- Talented coaches plateau
- Clients wait for availability
- Coaches turn away business

### 2. Client Onboarding is Manual & Slow

**The Problem:**
- Every new client requires 1:1 time to understand context
- Coaches repeat the same foundational conversations
- No system preserves insights between sessions
- Context gets lost when coaches are busy

**The Impact:**
- Inconsistent client experience
- Time wasted on repetitive conversations
- Clients feel unheard when context is forgotten

### 3. No-Shows & Admin Kill Profitability

**Industry Data:**
- No-shows are a top challenge for coaches
- Scheduling back-and-forth wastes hours
- Note-taking and follow-up admin is unpaid work
- 20-30% of "coaching time" is actually admin

### 4. AI is Coming (Whether Coaches Like It Or Not)

**The Threat:**
- Clients will use ChatGPT/Claude for coaching-like conversations
- Pure human coaches become uncompetitive on price and availability
- "Why pay $200/hour when AI is $20/month?"

**The Opportunity:**
- Coaches who use AI will outperform those who don't
- AI-augmented coaching = best of both worlds
- Human judgment + AI availability = unbeatable combo

### 5. WhatsApp is the Operating System for Coaches

**The Reality:**
- Coaches already use WhatsApp for client communication
- Moving to a new platform = friction and adoption resistance
- Clients prefer WhatsApp over email/portal/apps
- But WhatsApp is stateless — no memory, no tracking, no AI
