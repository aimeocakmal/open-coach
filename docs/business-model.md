## BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) Model

### How It Works

1. **Coach brings their own AI API key** (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, Kimi)
2. **Coach pays AI provider directly** for token usage
3. **OpenCoach charges only for platform features**

### Why This Works

**For Coaches:**
- Transparent AI costs (no markup)
- Control over AI model quality
- Costs scale with actual usage
- No surprise bills

**For OpenCoach:**
- Zero AI infrastructure costs
- No margin squeeze as AI gets cheaper
- Focus on platform value, not compute
- Sustainable unit economics

### AI Cost Estimates (Coach Perspective)

| Scenario | Messages/Month | Est. AI Cost |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| 1 client, light usage | 100 | ~$2-5 |
| 10 clients, moderate | 1,000 | ~$20-50 |
| 50 clients, heavy | 5,000 | ~$100-250 |

## Revenue Projections

### Market Sizing

**Total Addressable Market (TAM):**

- TAM = $74M ARR potential

**Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM):**

## Pricing Psychology

### Anchoring Strategy

**The Comparison:**
- 1 hour of coaching: $150-300
- 1 month of OpenCoach Pro: $49

**The Pitch:**
> "For less than the cost of one coaching session, get AI support for 10 clients all month long"

### Value-Based Pricing

Don't price based on costs. Price based on:
- Time saved for coaches
- Additional revenue from more clients
- Client satisfaction improvement
- 24/7 availability premium

---

## Risks

### Pricing Risks
- **Underpricing:** Could leave money on table
- **Overpricing:** Slows adoption in price-sensitive market
- **Solution:** Start low, increase as value is proven

### Churn Risks
- Coaches may churn if AI quality doesn't meet expectations
- Economic downturn affects discretionary spending
- **Mitigation:** Focus on ROI, time savings metrics
